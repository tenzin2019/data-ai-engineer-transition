# Intelligent Document Analysis System

## Project Overview

The Intelligent Document Analysis System is a GenAI-powered document processing platform that extracts insights, summarizes content, and generates actionable recommendations from complex business documents. This system leverages Azure OpenAI, Document AI, and advanced NLP techniques to provide intelligent document understanding and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Document Processing**: Support for PDF, Word, Excel, and other common document formats
- **Intelligent Information Extraction**: AI-powered extraction of key information, entities, and relationships
- **Automated Summarization**: Generate concise summaries and insights from complex documents
- **Custom Entity Recognition**: Identify and extract domain-specific entities and concepts
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing business workflows and systems
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit-based interface for document upload and analysis

## Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: Azure OpenAI, Document AI, spaCy, Transformers
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2, python-docx, openpyxl, pdfplumber
- **NLP**: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Cloud**: Azure AI Services, Azure Storage
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
